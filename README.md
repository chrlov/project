Welcome to our BAN400 term project!

Project idea:
Create a shiny app that provides users the ability to visualize crises and conflicts data on a geographical map.

Requirements:
The app must retrieve data from an online source (i.e. use the latest available data).
The app must dynamically respond to changes in the data (i.e. limit hard-coding to a minimum).
The app must be available through a web browser from a different location.
The end-user must be able to filter/switch between time periods, event(s) and location(s) (e.g. year/month/day, type of event, and/or region/country).
The data and analysis must have tests built-in, and the end-user must be notified (at our discretion) the results of these tests.
All source code of the app is documented on Git/GitHub.
All functions/code are documented, and the code is written in such a way that outsiders without difficulty can interpret it
