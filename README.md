Welcome to our BAN400 term project!

Project idea:
Create a shiny app that provides users the ability to visualize crises and conflicts data on a geographical map.

Requirements:
The app must retrieve data from an online source (i.e. use the latest available data).
The app must dynamically respond to changes in the data (i.e. limit hard-coding to a minimum).
The app must be available through a web browser from a different location.
The end-user must be able to filter/switch between time periods, event(s) and location(s) (e.g. year/month/day, type of event, and/or region/country).
The data and analysis must have tests built-in, and the end-user must be notified (at our discretion) the results of these tests.
All source code of the app is documented on Git/GitHub.
All functions/code are documented, and the code is written in such a way that outsiders without difficulty can interpret it

We have created the folder "R" where we have categorized the different parts of the code. This can be run in its entirety in the file app.R. Furthermore, in the folder "Data" you can get insight into the data basis used in the code. This only shows the data at the time the file was downloaded, otherwise this data is updated regularly.

The app is available online at the following URL: http://hbratsberg.shinyapps.io/ban400_term_paper
